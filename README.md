TODO:

- Write a better version of this.


What's this for?

As far as I can tell, I wrote this to rename image files as to conform them to a common naming scheme.


Example use case - i.e the problem I was solving:

- Take screenshot with EA launcher
- Take screenshot with Ubisoft launcher
- They have different naming schemes
- Drop the script in, and rename the screenshots with either naming scheme:

  - Windows: YYYY-MM-DD (N)
  - Steam: AppID_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_N

  ...where N is any duplicates
